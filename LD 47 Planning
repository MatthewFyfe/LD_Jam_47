LD 47 Planning

Theme: "Stuck in a loop"

Ideas: video game adaptation of A Cluck in Time?
 - A turn based tactical combat like Xcom / actual DnD would be nice... but maybe too hard
 - Compromise: make it clasic rpg like Final Fantasy with cut away battles, less fun but easy


Todo List:
 - Create 2D overworld system (Earthbound style?)
 - Create 2D battle system (turn based?)
 - Create game map for overworld
 - Make some enemies for battle system
 - Add game menus
 - Add equipment or at least level up system

 Art List:
  - Overworld sprites (ground, houses, forest, cave, interior, river)
  - Character sprites?
  - Monster sprites 
  - Menus
  - The Time Egg

 Sound List:
  - Overworld theme
  - Specific sub-region themes?


Combat System:
  - Just do regular turn based rpg. Have quick and slow player actions to determine who goes first (a quick attack for normal damage, slow attack for 1.5x, etc)
  - Have 2 or 3 party member slots? Can be filled with various other npcs
  - Give xp and loot, go to town to use it (training, shop)

  - Scratch that all, I'll just do "God of Thunder" style gameplay. Seems like less work

Main Story:
  - player has 24 minutes (hours) to save the time egg, if the egg is damaged time resets.
  - Expected gameplay is to restart a few times and find the optimal path.
  - Each playthrough should be quick and not have too many tedius sections

Monsters:
  - Hogweed (done)
  - Gremlints (done)
  - People (knight done, villager done)
  - Chickens (mostly done)
