LD 47 Planning

Theme: "Stuck in a loop"

Ideas: video game adaptation of A Cluck in Time?
 - A turn based tactical combat like Xcom / actual DnD would be nice... but maybe too hard
 - Compromise: make it clasic rpg like Final Fantasy with cut away battles, less fun but easy


Todo List:
 - Create 2D overworld system (Earthbound style?)
 - Create 2D battle system (turn based?)
 - Create game map for overworld
 - Make some enemies for battle system
 - Add game menus
 - Add equipment or at least level up system

 Art List:
  - Overworld sprites (ground, houses, forest, cave, interior, river)
  - Character sprites?
  - Monster sprites 
  - Menus
  - The Time Egg

 Sound List:
  - Overworld theme
  - Specific sub-region themes?
